# Predict-Customer-Clicked-Ads-Classification-by-Using-Machine-Learning
#4 Mini Project at Rakamin Academy

In this project, machine learning modeling will be carried out, to predict potential users in digital advertising.

The business team wants to optimize its advertising methods on digital platforms in order to get potential users to click on a product. So that the cost to be incurred is not too high, create a machine learning model that detects potential users to convert or be interested in an advertisement so that we can optimize costs in advertising on digital platforms.
